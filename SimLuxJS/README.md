SimLuxJS is an open JavScript-based discrete event simulator.

Please read the conference paper (*.pdf) first for a short history and the common goal fo the project.

In the repo you will find SimLuxJS-kernel in the file SimLuxJS.js.

You can find running example simulation models in the examples directory. There are three subdirectories:
- browser: The .js-files in here are meant to be run as script in a browser. Open the htmlExample.html to see how it works.
- nodejs:	These files can be run via Node.js.
- python: ... coming soon ...

The directory "Performance Tests" contains some examples to measure the performance of SimLuxJS in comparison to their python equivalents.
